## How to run  
Run "python3 ./src/compiler.py <directory_name>" in command line.

## Notes
1. <directory_name> is the name of the directory where the .jack file(s) resides. The directory can either be absolute path or relative path.
2. After the program finish running, navigate to the input directory, each .jack file will have a corresponding .vm file.
3. This program did not pass wet tests. I will keep probing.
